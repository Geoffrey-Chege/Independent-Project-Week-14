R-Pubs link [here](https://rpubs.com/Geoffrey_Chege/914136).

### Description        
- I am a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and I am currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax).
- I am to reduce the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA.

### Experimental Design

- Problem Definition.
- Loading the necessary libraries and the dataset.
- Data Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Univariate Analysis.
  - Bivariate Analysis.
- Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-sne).
- Part 2: Feature Engineering using unsupervised learning.
- Recommendations.
